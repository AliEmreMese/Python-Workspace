If the code doesn't work, follow these steps:
1.Find where you downloaded the project file and open the file.
2.Right click on the students or books txt file and copy it as path.
3.Go to the code on lines 126, 127, 165 and 166 and change the file path to the path you copied (If it says things like \n, put \\).
4.If you did all the steps correctly, the code should work.


Note:
For the project to work properly, it must be exited after each step because the entered information is written to the relevant files when exited.
